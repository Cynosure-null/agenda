** Distance formula 
\begin{equation}
d = \sqrt {\left( {x_1 - x_2 } \right)^2 + \left( {y_1 - y_2 } \right)^2 }
\end{equation}

+ Used to find distance between two points

** AA criterion
+ If two pairs of angles are the same, that means the third is also the same
+ If the thrid is the same, all three are the same. This makes the triangle congruent

** Ratios 
+ If you have a ratio, you can cross multilpy to get the answer
