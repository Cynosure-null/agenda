:END:
 - [X] get rid of ~Take::TakePeriodic()~
 - [X] Add more detailed logic in teleop
 - [X] Restructure ~Take.h~ code
    - [X] Hold ball
    - [X] Eject ball
    - [X] Color sensing
- [X] Msc Bug fixes
* TODO [#B] Main Teleop
SCHEDULED: <2022-02-12 Sat>
* TODO [#B] PID framework
 - [ ] Take
 - [ ] Shooter?
 - [ ] Climber?
     

+ Add more code for teleoperated mode, do other things before the climber
+ don't get the branch out of date
* DELAYED [#B] Climber Teleop
Ask Crosby for more info about this. All that is needed is a prototype, not a finished product





* PID notes
** Values
*** P value:
Proportonal 
Most important, edit first.
Changes gain based on distance from target
A higher P value leads to getting to target faster but more oscilation 
*** I value:
Integral
Smooths out errors
*** D value:
Differentail
Like P but different

** MSC:
How to execute PIDs:
~m_motorPIDControler.SetReference(position, controlType);~

+ The farther away from the desired position, the stonger the force is
